          Pig Beach located on Big Major Cay (also known as Major Cay) is a
          beach on an uninhabited island (or cay) located in Exuma, the Bahamas.
          The island takes its unofficial name from the fact that it is
          populated by a colony of feral pigs which live on the island. It has
          become a tourist attraction in modern times.<br />

          The pigs are known in popular culture as "the swimming pigs" although
          other islands with swimming pigs exist in the Bahamas.<br />
