          <p class="section-2__text">
            Mexican food is a vibrant cuisine known for its bold flavors and
            rich cultural heritage. Key ingredients include corn, beans, chili
            peppers, avocados, and various meats. Iconic dishes like tacos,
            filled with diverse ingredients, and mole, a complex sauce often
            served with meat, highlight this cuisine's diversity. Regional
            specialties, such as Oaxacan mole and Yucatán achiote dishes,
            showcase unique flavors. Street food, including elote (grilled corn)
            and quesadillas, is integral to the culture. Overall, Mexican
            cuisine combines indigenous traditions with Spanish and other
            influences, making it beloved worldwide for its deliciousness and
            communal dining experiences.

          <p class="section-2__text">
            Burritos are a popular Mexican dish consisting of a flour tortilla
            wrapped around various fillings. Originating in northern Mexico,
            they typically include ingredients like rice, beans, meat (such as
            beef, chicken, or pork), cheese, and fresh vegetables. Burritos can
            be customized to suit individual tastes, with options for salsas,
            guacamole, and sour cream as toppings. Often enjoyed as a convenient
            and hearty meal, burritos are commonly found in taquerías and
            fast-casual restaurants. They can be served wet, smothered in sauce,
            or dry, making them versatile for different dining experiences.
            Burritos reflect the rich flavors of Mexican cuisine and have become
            a beloved dish in many countries, celebrated for their convenience
            and satisfying combinations of flavors.

          <p class="section-2__text">
            Tacos are a quintessential Mexican dish made from a folded or rolled
            tortilla filled with a variety of ingredients. Traditionally, corn
            tortillas are used, though flour tortillas have become popular in
            many regions. Tacos can be filled with an array of options,
            including seasoned meats like beef, chicken, pork, or fish, as well
            as beans, cheese, and fresh vegetables. Tacos are often garnished
            with toppings such as salsa, guacamole, cilantro, and onions,
            allowing for endless customization. They can be served in various
            styles, including street tacos, which are simple and flavorful, or
            more elaborate versions with multiple ingredients. Widely enjoyed
            for their portability and versatility, tacos are a staple of Mexican
            street food culture and have gained immense popularity worldwide.
            Their combination of flavors and textures makes them a favorite for
            casual dining and gatherings.
