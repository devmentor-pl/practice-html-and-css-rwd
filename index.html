        <h2>About These Projects</h2>
        <p>These projects are part of my journey in learning HTML and CSS, with a focus on responsiveness. As a significant portion of web traffic comes from mobile devices, I've been learning to create websites that adapt to different screen sizes. This involves understanding relative units, CSS breakpoints, and making text, images, videos, and menus responsive. I've also been exploring flexbox and grid layouts.</p>
        <p>Each project represents a step in my learning journey. They are simple yet significant milestones that have helped me understand and appreciate the intricacies of web development. Feel free to explore these projects and see my progress.</p>
